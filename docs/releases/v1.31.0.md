- [[#320](https://github.com/sighupio/fury-distribution/pull/320)] **Custom Lables and Annotations for on-premises nodes**: the configuration file for on-premises clusters now supports specifying custom labels and annotations for the control-plane nodes and for the node groups. The labels and annotations specified will be applied to all the nodes in the group (and deleted when removed from the configuration). Usage example:

  ```yaml
  ...
  spec:
    kubernetes:
      masters:
        hosts:
          - name: master1
            ip: 192.168.66.29
          - name: master2
            ip: 192.168.66.30
          - name: master3
            ip: 192.168.66.31
        labels:
          node-role.kubernetes.io/dungeon-master: ""
          dnd-enabled: "true"
        annotations:
          level: "100"
      nodes:
        - name: infra
          hosts:
            - name: infra1
              ip: 192.168.66.32
            - name: infra2
              ip: 192.168.66.33
            - name: infra3
              ip: 192.168.66.34
          taints:
            - effect: NoSchedule
              key: node.kubernetes.io/role
              value: infra
          labels:
            a-label: with-content
            empty-label: ""
            label/sighup: "with-slashes"
            node-role.kubernetes.io/wizard: ""
            dnd-enabled: "true"
          annotations:
            with-spaces: "annotation with spaces"
            without-spaces: annotation-without-spaces
            level: "20"
        - name: worker
          hosts:
            - name: worker1
              ip: 192.168.66.35
          taints: []
          labels:
            node-role.kubernetes.io/barbarian: ""
            dnd-enabled: "true"
            label-custom: "with-value"
          annotations:
            level: "10"
        - name: empty-labels-and-annotations
          hosts:
            - name: empty1
              ip: 192.168.66.50
          taints: []
          labels:
          annotations:
        - name: undefined-labels-and-annotations
          hosts:
            - name: undefined1
              ip: 192.168.66.51
          taints: []
  ...
  ```

- [[#322](https://github.com/sighupio/fury-distribution/pull/322)] **Apply step now uses `kapp`**: The manifests apply for distribution phase and kustomize plugins is now done via `kapp` instead of `kubectl`. `kapp` allows for applying manifests and verifying that everything being installed is functioning correctly. It can also apply CRDs, wait for them to be available, and then apply the referring CRs. This significantly reduces and simplifies the complexity of apply operations, which were previously performed with plain kubectl.
