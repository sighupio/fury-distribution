## Upgrade path

From this version, we are introducing the new versioning system, see the [versioning documentation file][versioning] to know more about the new versioning scheme of the distribution and the upgrade path.

### Katalog Procedure

To upgrade the distribution from `v1.21.x` to `v1.22.0`, you need to download this new version, vendor the dependencies, finally applying the `kustomize` project.

```bash
furyctl vendor -H
kustomize build . | kubectl apply -f -
```

> **NOTE**: *The upgrade takes some minutes (depends on the cluster size), and you should expect some downtime during the upgrade process.*
