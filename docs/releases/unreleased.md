## New features üåü

- [[#353](https://github.com/sighupio/fury-distribution/pull/353)] **Add EKS self-managed node pool default override options for IDMS**: add a variable to override the default properies for EKS self-managed node pools. Currently support only the IDMS ones.

## Fixes üêû

- [[#334](https://github.com/sighupio/fury-distribution/pull/334)] **Fix to policy module templates**: setting the policy module type to `gatekeeper` and the `additionalExcludedNamespaces` option for Kyverno at the same time resulted in an error do to an bug in the templates logic, this has been fixed.
- [[#336](https://github.com/sighupio/fury-distribution/pull/336)] **Fix race condition when deleting Kyverno**: changing the policy module type from `kyverno` to `none` could, sometimes, end up in a race condition where the API for ClusterPolicy CRD is unregistered before the deletion of the ClusterPolicy objects, resulting in an error in the deletion command execution. The deletion command has been tweaked to avoid this condition.
- [[#344](https://github.com/sighupio/fury-distribution/pull/344)] **Fix Cidr Block additional firewall rule in EKS Cluster**: remove the limitation to have a single CIDR Block additional firewall rule as the EKS installer supports a list.
- [[#348](https://github.com/sighupio/fury-distribution/pull/348)] **Fix `Get previous cluster configuration` failure on first apply**: fixed an issue on `furyctl apply` for on-premises clusters that made it fail with an `ansible-playbook create-playbook.yaml: command failed - exit status 2` error on the very first time it was executed.
