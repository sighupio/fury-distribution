## Breaking changes üíî

- **Loki store and schema change**: A new store and schema has been introduced in order to improve efficiency, speed and scalability of Loki clusters. See "[New features](#new-features-)" below for more details.
- **DR schema change**: A new format for the schedule customization has been introduced to improve the usability. See "[New Features](#new-features-)" section below for more details.
- **Kyverno validation failure action**: Kyverno has deprecated `audit` and `enforce` as valid options for the `validationFailureAction`, valid options are now `Audit` and `Enforce`, in title case. Adjust your `.spec.distribution.modules.policy.kyverno.validationFailureAction` value accordingly.

## New features üåü

- **New option for Logging**: Loki's configuration has been extended to accommodate a new `tsdbStartDate` **required** option to allow a migration towards TSDB and schema v13 storage (note: **this is a breaking change**):

  ```yaml
  ...
  spec:
    distribution:
      modules:
        logging:
          loki:
            tsdbStartDate: "2024-11-18"
  ...
  ```

  - `tsdbStartDate` (**required**): a string in `ISO 8601` date format that represents the day starting from which Loki will record logs with the new store and schema.

  ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Note**: Loki will assume the start of the day on the UTC midnight of the specified day.

- **Improved configurable schedules for DR backups**: the schedule configuration has been updated to enhance the usability of schedule customization (note: **this is a breaking change**):

  ```yaml
  ...
  spec:
    distribution:
      modules:
        dr:
          velero:
            schedules:
              install: true
              definitions:
                manifests:
                  schedule: "*/15 * * * *"
                  ttl: "720h0m0s"
                full:
                  schedule: "0 1 * * *"
                  ttl: "720h0m0s"
                  snapshotMoveData: false
  ...
  ```

- **DR snapshotMoveData options for full schedule**: a new parameter has been introduced in the velero `full` schedule to enable the `snapshotMoveData` feature. This feature allows data captured from a snapshot to be copied to the object storage location. **Important**: Setting this parameter to `true` will cause Velero to upload all data from the snapshotted volumes to S3 using Kopia. While backups are deduplicated, significant storage usage is still expected. To enable this use the following parameter in the full schedule configuration:

  ```yaml
  ...
  spec:
    distribution:
      modules:
        dr:
          velero:
            schedules:
              install: true
              definitions:
                full:
                  snapshotMoveData: true
  ...
  ```

General example to enable Volume Snapshotting on rook-ceph (from our storage add-on module):

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: snapshot.storage.k8s.io/v1
  kind: VolumeSnapshotClass
  metadata:
  name: velero-snapclass
  labels:
    velero.io/csi-volumesnapshot-class: "true"
  driver: rook-ceph.rbd.csi.ceph.com
  parameters:
    clusterID: rook-ceph
    csi.storage.k8s.io/snapshotter-secret-name: rook-csi-rbd-provisioner
    csi.storage.k8s.io/snapshotter-secret-namespace: rook-ceph
  deletionPolicy: Retain
  ```

`deletionPolicy: Retain` is important because if the volume snapshot is deleted from the namespace, the cluster wide `volumesnapshotcontent` CR will be preserved, maintaining the snapshot on the storage that the cluster is using.

**NOTE**: For EKSCluster provider, a default VolumeSnapshotClass is created automatically.

- **DR optional snapshot-controller installation**: To leverage VolumeSnapshots on the OnPremises and SDDistribution providers, a new option on velero has been added to install the snapshot-controller component. Before activating this parameter make sure that in your cluster there is not another snapshot-controller component deployed. By default this parameter is `false`.

  ```yaml
  ...
  spec:
    distribution:
      modules:
        dr:
          velero:
            snapshotController:
              install: true
  ...
  ```

- **Prometheus ScrapeConfigs**: the Monitoring module now enables by default the `scrapeConfig` CRDs from the Prometheus Operator. All the scrapeConfig objects present in the cluster will now be detected by the operator. `ScrapeConfig` objects are used to instruct Prometheus to scrape specific endpoints that could be outside the cluster.

- **Components Hardening**: we hardened the security context of several components, improving the out-of-the-box security of the distribution.

- **On-premises minimal clusters**: it is now possible to create clusters with only control-plane nodes, for minimal clusters installations that need to handle minimal workloads.

- **Helm Plugins**: Helm plugins now allow disabling validation at installation time with the `disableValidationOnInstall` option. This can be useful when installing Helm charts that fail the diff step on a first installation, for example.

- **Network Policies** (experimental üß™): a new experimental feature is introduced in this version. You can now enable the installation of network policies that will restrict the traffic across all the infrastructural namespaces of SD to just the access needed for its proper functioning and denying the rest of it. Improving the overall security of the cluster. This experimental feature is only available in OnPremises cluster at the moment. Read more in the [Pull Request](https://github.com/sighupio/fury-distribution/pull/302) introducing the feature and in the [relative documentation](https://github.com/sighupio/fury-distribution/tree/main/docs/network-policies).

- **Global CVE patched images for core modules**: This distribution version includes images that have been patched for OS vulnerabilities (CVE). To use these patched images, select the following option:
  ```yaml
  ...
  spec:
    distribution:
      common:
        registry: registry.sighup.io/fury-secured
  ...
  ```
