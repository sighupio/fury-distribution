## Overview

SIGHUP Distribution (SD) is a [CNCF certified](https://landscape.cncf.io/?selected=fury-distribution) battle-tested Kubernetes distribution based purely on upstream Kubernetes.

It is developed and maintained by [SIGHUP by ReeVo][sighup-site] and the community, and it is fully open source.

> 🎯 The goal of SD is to turn any standard Kubernetes cluster into a fully-configured production-grade cluster.
<!-- separator -->
> Previously known as KFD (Kubernetes Fury Distribution), the project is now officially named SIGHUP Distribution. ReeVo has acquired SIGHUP, but the project will continue to be open-source and freely available without any changes to its functionality.

## Un-distribution model 🧬

SD uses an **un-distribution model**. This means that we:

- Rely only on open source solutions.
- Are free from vendor lock-in.
- Stay close to upstream Kubernetes and the cloud native landscape.
- Choose, configure and integrate a set of battle-tested open source tools.

## Architecture 🏗

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033 MD045 -->
<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/assets/skd-architecture.png" width="800px"/>
</p>
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD033 MD045 -->

SIGHUP Distribution is structured on modules, and each module has a set of packages.

- A package is a single unit of functionality.
- A module groups packages that are functionally related together.

> All modules are open source, widely used, easily customizable, and pre-configured with sane defaults and tested to work well together.

The standard way to deploy SD is to:

- Create a cluster using one of the supported providers (EKS, On-Premises, Immutable), or bring your own cluster using the `KFDDistribution` provider.
- Deploy all the [Core Modules](#core-modules-) of the distribution using [furyctl][furyctl].
- Deploy (if needed) any of the [Addon modules](#add-on-modules-) using [furyctl plugin][furyctl-plugins] feature.

See the getting started section below for more information.

### Requirements

SD is a modular and composable system, so hardware requirements ultimately depend on the modules and configuration chosen and on the provider. Refer to the [requirements section][sd-docs-requirements] of the documentation site for more details.

### Core Modules 📦

Core modules provide essential functionality to the distribution for production-grade clusters.

| Module                          | Included Release               | Description                                                                                      |

### Add-on Modules 📦

Add-on modules provide additional functionality to the distribution. Their release cycle is independent of SD's.

## CNCF Certified 🎓

Each version of the SIGHUP Distribution that introduces compatibility with a new version of Kubernetes goes through a [conformance certification process with the CNCF][cncf-conformance]. Certified solutions are validated to ensure a set of guarantees such as consistency, timely updates and confirmability.

SD has been certified by the [CNCF] (Cloud Native Computing Foundation) as a _Certified Kubernetes Distribution_ for all Kubernetes versions since [Kubernetes 1.12](https://github.com/cncf/k8s-conformance/pull/619). Clicking on the badge below you can see the certification process for the latest version of SD:
